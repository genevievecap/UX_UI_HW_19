            <img id="final" src="images/JCC.png">
            <p>We focused on keeping a concise color palette and decided to refactor some of the pages. We also added a login feature as well as giving user's the ability to track applications and apply online, all of which were generated ideas from our interviews.</p>

            <h2>The testing phase...</h2>
            <p>Our group tested our final prototype and made the color palette more simple per our feedback. However, we failed to notice our color palette doesn't meet accessibility standards. If we had more time, we would've corrected this mistake.</p>
